Hi! I'm Lan, or I go by it because other words in my name aren't in my preference yet. I have tried for quite sometimes to get personal website running, then decided that webdev is not my cup of tea enough to reinvent nicer wheels that others (like authors of this one) have created. 

I studied Maths and Computer Science at Swarthmore College, worked at Salesforce in Search Relevance, Query Engine (both briefly for 3 months), and spent the rest in the Infrastructure Secrets team, where I worked with deploying HashiCorp Vault in AWS and 1P cloud.

In a week, or as of 2/22/2021 I'll be joining the flock at Twitter's Video Data Infrastructure team!
